Darious Flores' first repository!!!

Hello, world! 
My name is Darious Flores. I'm a 20 year old student who is new coding. 
I have a passion for technology, and would like to become a software engineer. 
I'm currently teaching myself to code on www.codeacademy.com and www.github.com. 
I hope to someday be accepted into Hack Reactor's Austin campus so that i can begin my new vocation. 
I'm passionate about music and learning new things.
I have a cat named Kitty-Wags, and i love to play guitar.
I taught myself to play, and i write my own songs.
A dream of mine is to release an album, and go on tour.
